We recommend using our [Tomcat Instance Framework](https://github.com/EuPathDB/tomcat-instance-framework) (TcIF)for managing Tomcat deployments. TcIF provides a framework for managing multiple instances of Tomcat so you can easily separate development and production deployments. The framework also provides administrative tools and commands to allow developers to start/stop/reload their own webapps.
