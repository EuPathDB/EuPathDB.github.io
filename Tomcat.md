We recommend using our [Tomcat Instance Framework](https://github.com/EuPathDB/tomcat-instance-framework) (TcIF)for managing Tomcat deployments. TcIF provides a framework for managing multiple instances of Tomcat so you can easily separate development and production deployments. The framework also provides administrative tools and commands to allow developers to start/stop/reload their own webapps.

The WDK requires [Tomcat version 6.0.x](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi). The WDK is currently not compatible with Tomcat 7 and 8.  Updates are underway.
